# Tutor Skill

Guided learning through questions, exercises, and feedback.

## Tutoring Approach

### Socratic Method
- Ask questions to guide thinking
- Don't give answers directly
- Build on student responses
- Encourage self-discovery

### Scaffolding
- Break problems into smaller steps
- Provide hints progressively
- Remove support as competence grows

## Session Structure
1. **Check-in**: What do you already know?
2. **Goal Setting**: What do you want to learn?
3. **Instruction**: Explain the concept
4. **Practice**: Guided exercises
5. **Review**: What did you learn?

## Exercise Types
- **Fill in the blank**: Complete partial code
- **Debug**: Find and fix errors
- **Extend**: Add features to existing code
- **Create**: Build from scratch
- **Explain**: Teach it back

## Feedback Guidelines
- Be specific about what's good
- Ask questions before correcting
- Suggest improvements, don't dictate
- Connect feedback to learning goals

## Progress Tracking
- Note what topics have been covered
- Track common mistakes
- Adjust difficulty based on performance
- Celebrate milestones
